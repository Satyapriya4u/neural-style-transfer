# Neural Style Transfer
Implementation of Neural Style Transfer from the paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576">A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style</a> in Keras 2.0+

## Colaboratory Support

[This codebase can now be run directly from colaboratory using the following link](https://github.com/Satyapriya4u/neural-style-transfer/blob/29669154f7ecfbf4f109e2f5be3f44b4bec19f96/NeuralStyleTransfer.ipynb), or by opening `NeuralStyleTransfer.ipynb` and visiting the Colab link.

**NOTE :** Make sure you use a GPU in Colab or else the notebook will fail. To change Runtimes : `Runtime -> Change Runtime type ->`. Here select Python 3 and GPU as the hardware accelerator.
